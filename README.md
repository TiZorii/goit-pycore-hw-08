## Home task. Working with Files and Modular System

#### Task Description

> ‚òù In this homework assignment, you need to add functionality to save the address book to disk and restore it from disk.

To do this, you should choose the `pickle` protocol for data serialization/deserialization and implement methods that allow you to save all data to a file and load it from a file.

**The main goal** is to ensure that the application does not lose data after exiting the application and restores it from the file when launched. The address book with which we worked in the previous session should be preserved.

Implement functionality to save the state of the **`AddressBook`** to a file when the program closes and restore the state when it starts.
